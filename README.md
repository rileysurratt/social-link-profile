## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- styled a paragraph to give the illusion of a button
``` css
.button {
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    padding: 8px 12px;
    font-size: 14px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
- when creating card like features, create as many nested containers to optomize customization 

# Colors

Primary

- Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%)

Neutral

- White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
- Grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%)
- Dark Grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%)
- Off Black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%)

# Typography

Body Copy

- Font size (paragraph): 14px

# Font

- Weights: 400, 600, 700

### Continued development

- recreating this style with active buttons and links



### Useful resources

- [UIverse](https://uiverse.io/) - This helped me get an idea for proportion sizes for different size cards based on content.
